	• Profile data set and auxiliary data that consists of 145 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae whose partial genome sequence was publicly available (1, 2). The allelic information of 237 loci is considered in an arbitrary cgMLST scheme.
		• Profile Data           [profileData.tab, a tsv file]         ie this require having ST and generate allele info, bionumerics have a workflow for this
		• Auxiliary Data       [isolateData.tab ]
	• Fasta sequences and auxiliay data from a set of whole genome sequencing data from a number of V. Cholerae strains from the outbreak of cholera in Haiti beginning in 2010 as well as a number of other V. cholerae strains included for comparison. More information available here.
		• Fasta/SNP Data   [snp_example…fasta]
		• Auxiliary Data      [snp_example_phyloviz_auxiliary.tsv ]
	• Newick and auxiliay data files from a Streptococcus pneumoniae data set publicly available at here.

some rows removed here for Embargo spirit
slightly modified also (header to ST).  some rows shuffled to better show up in head -5
